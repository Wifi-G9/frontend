I personally use WebStorm from JETBRAINS but I guess you can use VSCode to do this.

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm:
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/.

Git (Optional):
If you want to clone the repository using Git, make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from https://git-scm.com/.

# Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
cd your-repo

# Step 3: Install Dependencies
npm install

# Step 4: Start the Development Server
npm start

# Step 5: View the App
# Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000

# Additional Commands:
# Build the Production-Ready Bundle
npm run build
